# Image-Classification
* a Convolutional neural network is to be developed in order to classify images "Cfair-10".
* There are 9 different labels and the model should be trained, validated and then tested on 4500 samples.
* overall validation Accuracy of 72% was achieved.
* No regularisation methods was implemented.
* with Regularisation it is supposed to have an accuracy more than 80% by using Drop out layers and Batch Normalization.
